## Problem Statement
In an increasingly digital world, organizations are facing a significant rise in the frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks. These threats can lead to severe financial losses, data breaches, and compromised systems, posing a substantial risk to operational integrity and security. The challenge is to develop an advanced cyber attack detection system that can accurately and swiftly identify malicious activities in real-time, minimize false positives, and adapt to evolving attack vectors to protect sensitive data and maintain trust in digital infrastructures.

## SDLC

- Planning Phase:
     Define project scope, objectives, and requirements.
     Identify stakeholders and establish communication channels.

- Analysis Phase:
     Gather and analyze data related to cyber attacks and security incidents.
     Define the features and attributes of the data that are relevant for detection.
     Clean the collected data by removing noise and inconsistencies.
     Normalize or scale the data to ensure uniformity.
     Handle missing values and outliers appropriately.

- Implementation Phase:
     Develop the ML models using programming languages and libraries such as Python.
     Integrate the ML models into the overall cyber security infrastructure.

- Testing Phase:
     Evaluate the selected model using the testing dataset.
     Assess its performance using various evaluation metrics and confusion matrices.

- Deployment Phase:
     Integrate the trained model into a software application or system for real-time cyber attack detection.
     Develop user interfaces and APIs for interacting with the detection.

## Algorithms
- SVM:
        Preprocess the data by cleaning and transforming it into a format suitable for training the SVM model.
        SVM Creates a Hyperplane for classification.
- Naive Bayes :
       Naive Bayes is based on Bayes' theorem, which calculates the probability of a hypothesis given the data.
       Simple and Efficient: Naive Bayes is known for its simplicity and efficiency. 
- Decision Tree:
       Makes decisions based on if-else questions, simple to interpret.
       Represents data in a tree-like structure, aiding decision-making clarity.
- Random Forest:
       Utilizes multiple decision trees for predictions, enhancing accuracy.
       Reduces overfitting risks by combining predictions from different trees.

## Accuracy
- SVM: 76%
- Naive Bayes: 41%
- Decision Tree: 92%
- Random Forest: 93%

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the use of machine learning techniques in the cyber attack detection process is essential for combating an ever-evolving landscape of threats.
While it offers significant advantages, it is not a silver bullet, and human expertise and continuous adaptation are equally important. 
Looking ahead, machine learning will continue to play a crucial role in enhancing cybersecurity, but it must be used in conjunction with other security measures to effectively protect digital assets.
